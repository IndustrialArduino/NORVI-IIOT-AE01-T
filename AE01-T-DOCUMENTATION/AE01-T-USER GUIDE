Programming
NORVI-IIOT-AE01-T has a mini USB Port for serial connection with the SoC for programming. 
Any ESP32 supported programming IDE can be used to program the controller. 
Follow this Guide to programming NORVI ESP32 Based Controllers with Arduino IDE.
SoC: ESP32-WROOM32
Programming Port: USB UART

Digital Inputs 
The digital inputs of NORVI-IIOT-AE01-T can be configured as both a Sink and Source connection. The inverse of the Digital Input polar should be supplied to the common terminal.
Reading the relevant GPIO of ESP32 gives the value of the Digital Input. 
When the inputs are in the OFF state the GPIO goes HIGH, and when the input is in the ON stage, the GPIO goes LOW. 
Please look at the GPIO allocation table in the Datasheet for the digital input GPIO. 

Transistor Outputs 
Reading the relevant GPIO of ESP32 gives the value of the Transistor Output. 
Refer to the GPIO allocation table in the datasheet for the Transistor Output GPIO
